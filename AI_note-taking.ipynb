      "  Machine learning encompasses various techniques including backpropagation, which trains neural networks through error feedback and weight adjustments, and reinforcement learning, where models learn by receiving rewards or penalties. Activation functions determine neuron activation in neural networks, while gradient descent optimizes model parameters. Deep learning, surpassing human capabilities in perceptual tasks, involves deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers. Ensuring model generalizability requires dropout regularization to prevent overfitting, and combining transfer learning with fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets enhances performance. Notable milestones include OpenAI's ChatGPT hitting 100 million users in two months, highlighting AI's rapid growth.
